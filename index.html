            <h3>A Short Story About Myself</h3>
            <p>I'd like to share a short story about myself. I'd like to do this, to show people that life will always
                throw curveballs but what truly matters is you fight through it!Things will get better sooner or later.
                For the children out there that don't think they aren't worth it, because of bullies or family issues,
                you ARE worth it! Every life matters, and it might not seem like it but you are destined for something
                great! I have had a rough life and have thought multiple times that it would never get better. As I get
                older, I realize that the struggle I go through makes me who I am. I am a stronger person because of
                what I went through and still go through. </p>
